# Slayers App Front-End

This is the front-end code for [Slayers](https://slayers.netlify.app) dApp.

Slayers is a free turn-based NFT mini-game where the goal is to defeat the evil Desolator who is threatening the metaverse. There are seven characters to choose from, mint and bring to battle. The desolator has a mega HP of 20000. It is impossible to defeat him alone. Thus the more players who participate the higher the chance of defeating him.

Slayers lives on Ethereum's Rinkeby Test Network. Never send real Eth to your testnet address. If you did, you would lose it. [Testnets](https://medium.com/compound-finance/the-beginners-guide-to-using-an-ethereum-test-network-95bbbc85fc1d) use test Eth which you can get for free from [Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby) or other faucets. It is recommended that you create a separate wallet for use on test networks.
